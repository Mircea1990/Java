	Presents Management
Implement console program which will meet the following requirements:

1.Implement a hierarchy of Sweets. All Sweets should have next properties: 
	name, weight and sugarWeight. Weight is a weight of the specific sweet in kilograms. 
	sugarWeight is a weight of sugar in this sweet in kilograms.

2.Candy, Lollipop and Cookie - two other types from Sweet hierarchy.


3.Create class Present. Present has next behavior:

	// the method filters sweets by sugar weight inclusively
	public Sweet[] filterSweetsBySugarRange(double minSugarWeight, double maxSugarWeight) {
		<write your code here>
	}

	// the method calculates total weight of the present
	public double calculateTotalWeight() {
		<write your code here>
	}

	// the method that adds sweet to the present
	public void addSweet(Sweet sweet) {
		<write your code here>
	}


	// the method returns copy of the Sweet[] array so that nobody could
	// modify state of the present without addSweet() method.
	// Also array shouldnâ€™t contain null values
	public Sweet[] getSweets() {
		<write your code here>
	}
